Measure,Description
GINI index,The GINI index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or in some cases consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.
Income share held by top 10%,The Percentage share of income or consumption is the share that accrues to subgroups of population indicated by deciles or quintiles.
Poverty headcount ratio % (at national lines),The National poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty lines. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.
